When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to contribute from different computers(locations) and when I don't want to lose my project due to the failure of the hosting
computer.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Your local code may get broken when synced wihtout you starting it manually. You may not be at the right time to incorporate the new changes coming from reomtes. This gives the developer the freedom to decide when makes sense.
